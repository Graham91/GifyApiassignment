# GifyApiassignment
basically an good opportunity to work with a free API
link to project: https://graham91.github.io/GifyApiassignment/
basically what we have here is a link to a project that utalizes the gify API. 
click on the gifs to make them play. In the future I would like to update gifs so they individual remember how many times they have been clicked individually. As is you can turn one on everyother click, and turn one off everyother click.
another funny bug is since I used event target clicking next to a button will return the information of the entire container div. meaning you will get gif of buttons. its kind of funny. Ill have to look more into a solution for that.
you can also add buttons by inputing information into the input box and hitting add new animal.
